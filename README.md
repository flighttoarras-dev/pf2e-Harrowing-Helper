# Harrowing Helper

A [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module for Pathfinder 2e that automates the [Harrowing ritual](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=100).

So your GM let you run a Harrowing build? You don't want to spend the entire session rolling ritual checks and applying effects? Now you can have the AWESOME power of HARROWING RITUAL with all of the boring stuff automated.

---

## Features

- Rolls all Harrow checks automatically and resolves degrees of success
- Detects relevant feats and items on the caster (Experienced Harrower, Harrow Ritualist, Thaumaturgic Ritualist, Reading the Signs, Fine Harrow Deck)
- Handles Reading the Signs two-card draws with configurable suit preference strategies per party member
- Applies Harrowing effects directly to target actors — including actors not owned by the player running the ritual
- Supports a single target, a selected party member, or your entire configured party in one cast
- Posts a consolidated chat summary showing every draw, check result, and applied suit
- Clears existing Harrowing effects before reapplying (configurable)

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| Foundry VTT | v13+ |
| PF2e System | v7.8+ |
| [Advanced Macros](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/advanced-macros) | v2.3+ |

---

## Installation

**Method 1 — Foundry Module Browser**
Search for **Harrowing Helper** in the Foundry module browser and install directly.

**Method 2 — Manifest URL**
Paste the manifest URL into Foundry's **Install Module** dialog:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flighttoarras-dev/pf2e-Harrowing-Helper/main/module.json
```

---

## Setup

1. Enable the module and the **Advanced Macros** module in your world.
2. Import both macros from the **Harrowing Helper — Macros** compendium into your world.
3. Set **Harrowing Apply Effects** to **Observer** permission (right-click → Configure → Default Ownership: Observer). The module maintains this automatically on subsequent world loads.
4. Configure your party in the `TARGET_PREFS` section of the **Harrowing** macro — add each actor's UUID and their suit preference list using numbers 1–6:

| # | Suit | Associated Check |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hammers | Strikes |
| 2 | Keys | Reflex saves |
| 3 | Shields | Fortitude saves |
| 4 | Books | Skill checks |
| 5 | Stars | Will saves |
| 6 | Crowns | All other checks |

> **Note:** A GM must be logged in for the macro to function. The macro routes effect application through the GM to handle actors not owned by the casting player.

Full setup and configuration details are in the **Harrowing Helper — Documentation** journal included with the module.

---

## Usage

1. Select your caster token (or configure a fixed caster UUID).
2. Target the intended recipient token (for single-target mode).
3. Run the **Harrowing** macro.
4. Configure the setup dialog — apply mode, rank, cast limit — and click OK.
5. The macro rolls all checks, draws suits, applies effects, and posts a chat summary.

## Development

Compendium packs (**macros**, **documentation**) are stored two ways:

- `packs/_source/<pack-name>/*.json` — plaintext JSON, one file per document. This is the source of truth and what's committed to git.
- `packs/<pack-name>/` — the compiled LevelDB pack that Foundry actually loads. It's a generated build artifact (gitignored) — don't edit it directly.

Conversion between the two is handled by [`@foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli`](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli) via `scripts/packs.mjs`, which reads the pack list straight from `module.json`.

**Setup**

```
npm install
```

**Edit compendium content**

Edit the JSON files under `packs/_source/`, then compile them into the LevelDB packs Foundry reads:

```
npm run pack
```

**Pull changes made in Foundry back into JSON**

If you edited a macro or journal from inside Foundry (which writes to the compiled LevelDB pack), extract those changes back to plaintext JSON so they can be committed:

```
npm run unpack
```

> **Note:** `npm run unpack` reads the *compiled* pack, so any `{{MODULE_VERSION}}` placeholder (see below) will come back as a literal version number instead of the placeholder. If that happens, just swap it back to `{{MODULE_VERSION}}` in the JSON before committing.

**Version stamping**

Macro `command` text and the documentation journal use a `{{MODULE_VERSION}}` placeholder (e.g. `Harrowing (PF2e) — v{{MODULE_VERSION}}`) instead of a hardcoded version number. Every time `npm run pack` runs, it reads `module.json`'s `"version"` field and stamps it into any string containing that placeholder in the *compiled* pack - the JSON source keeps the literal placeholder. So bumping the version is just: update `module.json`, run `npm run pack`. The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) does this automatically using the release tag.

**Editing the documentation journal**

The documentation journal's page content is authored as HTML in `source/documentation.html` (much easier to edit than an HTML string embedded in JSON). After editing it, run:

```
npm run bake-docs
npm run pack
```

This copies the HTML into `packs/_source/documentation/*.json`, then `npm run pack` compiles it into the LevelDB pack.

**Editing macro code**

Macro `command` text is likewise authored as plain, syntax-highlighted `.js` files instead of an escaped JSON string:

- `source/macros/harrowing.js` — the **Harrowing** macro
- `source/macros/harrowing-apply-effects.js` — the **Harrowing Apply Effects** macro

After editing one, run:

```
npm run bake-macros
npm run pack
```

`bake-macros` matches each `.js` file to its macro by name (see `MACRO_FILES` in `source/bake-macros.cjs`) and writes it into that macro's `command` field under `packs/_source/macros/`, then `npm run pack` compiles it into the LevelDB pack. No manual hand-off through Foundry's macro editor required.
